Directory for binary stable release (not updated often).

Its a pain and totally unneccesary that people have to compile 
Java things themselves (its platform independent, remenmber? :-)

Its not necessary that all that wants to use dixtools must
compile it. They don't need for people to struggle JDK, ant and
Netbeans. They just need a Java runtime (JRE) and a precompiled
binary.


INSTALLING
sudo tar -C / -xvf apertium-dixtools-0.90.tgz

if you don't have sudo, try
su
tar -C / -xvf apertium-dixtools-0.90.tgz
